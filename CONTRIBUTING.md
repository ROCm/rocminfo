* If you're not sure if your issue is the same, err on the side of caution and file your issue.
  You can add a comment to include the issue number (and link) for the similar issue. If we evaluate
  your issue as being the same as the existing issue, we'll close the duplicate.
* If your issue doesn't exist, use the issue template to file a new issue.
  * When filing an issue, be sure to provide as much information as possible, including script output so
    we can collect information about your configuration. This helps reduce the time required to
    reproduce your issue.
  * Check your issue regularly, as we may require additional information to successfully reproduce the
    issue.
* You may also open an issue to ask questions to the maintainers about whether a proposed change
  meets the acceptance criteria, or to discuss an idea pertaining to the library.

## Acceptance Criteria for Contributions
The goal of `rocminfo` is to provide the user with all the system information that is known to and provided by the HSA/ROCr API. Anybody writing a ROCr application could use rocminfo to see the values the API would provide to their application. The included `rocm_agent_enumerator` prints the list of available AMD GCN ISA devices on the host. Keep these goals in mind when considering the suitability of any new changes; that is, do your changes improve the reliability or capability toward these goals.

## Coding Style
C++ code changes should conform to the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Pull Request Guidelines
When you create a pull request, you should target the `TODO ADD THIS` branch.  

By creating a pull request, you agree to the statements made in the [code license](#code-license) section. Your pull request should target the default branch. Our current default branch is the `TODO ADD THIS` branch, which serves as our integration branch.
